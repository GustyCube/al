## Interacting with Al

Once Al is online and invited to your server:

* **Ping Al**:
  Mention the bot anywhere in your message, e.g.
  `Hey @Al, what's the best low-level language?`

* **Reply to Al**:
  Reply to any of Alâ€™s previous messages.

Al will then generate a context-aware response using its memory and Ollama.
