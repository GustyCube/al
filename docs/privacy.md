# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: July 14th, 2025*

This Privacy Policy describes how **Al**, the conversational AI Discord bot (“we”, “us”, or “our”), handles your data when you interact with the bot on Discord.

## 1. Data Collection

* **Al does not collect personal data** beyond what is necessary to function as a Discord bot.
* When you interact with Al:

  * Your message content and Al’s replies may be stored locally in a file (e.g. `memory.jsonl`).
  * A **hashed version of your Discord user ID** may be stored to allow Al to maintain separate memories for different users without identifying you directly.
  * Your **display name** may be stored to personalize replies.

This data is used solely for maintaining conversational context and enhancing the user experience.

## 2. Local Storage Only

* All data is stored **locally** on the device where the bot is hosted.
* No data is transmitted to any third-party service, server, or analytics provider.
* If you are running the bot yourself, **you control all stored data.**

## 3. Discord Information

* Al uses the Discord API to read and respond to messages.
* Al only accesses:

  * Your message content (if you mention the bot or reply to it),
  * Your username, user ID (hashed if stored), and display name,
  * The server and channel the message was sent in.
* Al does not read private DMs unless explicitly invited into them.

## 4. Data Retention

* Conversation logs are stored in a file (`memory.jsonl`) and persist until manually deleted by the bot host.
* If you are not the host of the bot, you should contact the server owner or bot operator regarding locally stored data.

## 5. Your Rights

* Since Al stores data locally, the bot operator is responsible for managing that data.
* If you’d like your stored messages or data removed, contact the server owner or whoever runs the instance of the bot.

## 6. Security

* Data is stored in plaintext and is not encrypted.
* Hashed user IDs are used to reduce the risk of identifying users.
* It is the responsibility of the bot host to secure the server or machine where Al is running.

## 7. Changes to this Policy

* We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
* Updates will be posted publicly wherever the bot’s code or documentation is hosted.

## 8. Contact

For questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the bot developer or maintainer listed on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/myferr/al) or via [e-mail](mailto:contactme.myfer@protonmail.com)
